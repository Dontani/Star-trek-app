# Star Trek Species App

Welcome to the Star Trek Species App! This app allows you to explore the vast universe of Star Trek by searching for different species and learning about their unique characteristics.

## Features

- Search for a species by entering its name
- View a photo, species name, home world, distinguishing features, interesting fact(s), and notable examples
- LCARS-inspired website design for an authentic Star Trek experience

## API

This app utilizes an API I built specifically for Star Trek species information. The API provides detailed information on a wide range of species, including their physical characteristics, cultural attributes, and notable appearances in the Star Trek franchise.

## LCARS-Inspired Website Template

The website template for this app was designed and developed by Jim Robertus from TheLCARS.com. The LCARS design provides a unique and authentic Star Trek experience, with a sleek and futuristic user interface.

## Usage

To use the Star Trek Species App, simply enter the name of a species you are interested in learning about in the search bar. The app will display a photo of the species, along with information on their home world, distinguishing features, interesting fact(s), and notable examples from the Star Trek universe.

## Future Development

I am  working to improve the Star Trek Species App, and are exploring ways to expand the API to include additional information on Star Trek species, such as their cultural practices, technological advancements, and political systems. I also plan to add additional features to the app, such as the ability to save favorite species and share them on social media.
